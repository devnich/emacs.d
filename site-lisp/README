This is a place for 3rd party code which isn't available in MELPA or
other package repositories. This directory and its immediate subdirectories
will be added to load-path at start-up time.

How to install a non-ELPA package in /site-lisp/<module>

1. Clone into a subdirectory of ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/
2. Manually generate the <module>-autoloads.el file by running "M-x update-directory-autoloads"
3. Manually byte-compile <module>.el files by running "C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory"
4. If a (M)ELPA version is installed, remove it by running "M-x package-list-packages" and deleting the package
5. In necessary, update the corresponding /lisp/init-<module>.el to remove "(require-package <module>)" statement. This function automatically (re-)downloads the package from (M)ELPA. Use "(require <module>)" instead.
